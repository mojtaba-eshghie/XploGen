# XploGen: Oracle-Guided Vulnerability Diversity and Exploit Synthesis of Smart Contracts

XploGen is a method for synthesizing vulnerabilities and exploits for smart contracts using Large Language Models (LLMs). We leverage oracle-based specifications to diversify vulnerabilities and generate context-aware exploits that target business logic flaws in smart contracts.

## Overview

Smart contracts often suffer from vulnerabilities that can lead to significant financial losses. Existing analysis tools typically focus on low-level vulnerabilities and lack concrete exploit examples. XploGen addresses this gap by using formal business logic specifications to synthesize realistic vulnerability-exploit pairs.

## Features

- **Oracle-Guided Vulnerability Injection**: Uses a model-based oracle specification of smart contracts to inject business logic vulnerabilities.
- **Exploit Generation**: Automatically generates exploit scripts that can demonstrate how specific vulnerabilities can be exploited.
- **Diverse Contract Types**: Includes synthesized vulnerability-exploit pairs for various smart contract types, such as Governance, Escrow, and Auctions.

## Methodology

1. **Vulnerability Synthesis**: XploGen uses DCR (Dynamic Condition Response) graphs as business-logic specifications to guide the synthesis of vulnerabilities in smart contracts.
2. **Exploit Generation**: The tool generates exploits using LLMs by incorporating formal specifications into the prompt, ensuring precise and context-aware exploit generation.
3. **Monitoring and Validation**: Exploits are validated against the oracle specification using HighGuard, a monitoring tool that checks contract interactions against defined business logic rules.

## Repository Structure

- `diversified_vulnerabilities/`: Contains synthesized variants of smart contracts with injected vulnerabilities.
- `synthesized_exploits/`: Includes exploit scripts corresponding to each vulnerable contract.
- `benchmarks/`: Contains our ongoing work on benchmarking the work with ExGen, Teether, and more.

## Requirements

To deploy and test the exploits generated by XploGen, it suffices to have the following tool:

- [HighGuard](https://github.com/mojtaba-eshghie/HighGuard): A tool for monitoring smart contracts against DCR specifications.
